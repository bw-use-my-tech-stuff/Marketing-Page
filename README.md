# Marketing-Page

## Set up your preprocessor

- Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running `lessc -v` in your terminal.
- Open your terminal and navigate to the Marketing-Page project by using the `cd` command.
- Once in the project's root folder, run the following command `less-watch-compiler less css index.less`.
- Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the `background-color` on the `html` selector to `red` in the `index.less` file.
- Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start on the next task.

## Import LESS Files

- Import order is as follows:

1. `variables.less`
2. `mixins.less`
